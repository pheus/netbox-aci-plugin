like Tenants (TN), Application Profiles (AP), Endpoint Groups (EPG),
Endpoint Security Groups (ESG), Bridge Domains (BD) and

## Installing

For adding to a NetBox Docker setup, see
[the general instructions for using netbox-docker with plugins](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker/wiki/Using-Netbox-Plugins).

While this is still in development and not yet on pypi, you can install with
pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pheus/netbox-aci-plugin
```

or by adding to your `local_requirements.txt` or `plugin_requirements.txt`
(netbox-docker):

```bash
git+https://github.com/pheus/netbox-aci-plugin
```

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
 or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file :

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'netbox_aci_plugin'
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_aci_plugin": {
        # create default ACI Tenants "common", "infra", "mgmt" during migration
        "create_default_aci_tenants": True,
        # create default ACI Filters "arp", "icmp", "ip" during migration
        "create_default_aci_contract_filters": True,
    },
}
```

## Status

This project has just started and provides a minimal set of ACI object features.
It may contain bugs and it is missing features.
At the current stage, the plugin should be used in a testing environment only.
